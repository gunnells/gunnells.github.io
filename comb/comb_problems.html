<li><p>Extra problem 1: Build a GF for the following
constructions. It is not necessary to compute the coefficients
explicitly. Suppose we have beads in masses 1g, 2g, 3g, &#8230; .
Each bead comes in one of two different colors. Explain how to
count (1) Lists of seven beads with total mass n grams. (2) Arbitrary
length lists of beads with mass n grams. (3) Necklaces of arbitrary
size of beads with total mass n grams. (4) Number of ways to make a
bag of beads with total mass n grams. (5) Number of ways to make a
bag of beads with total mass n grams, where each bead of a given
color may be used at most once.</p></li>
<li><p>Extra problem 2: Thanksgiving dinner servings are to be assembled
from portions of turkey, stuffing, potatoes, cranberry sauce, gravy,
and Lemonheads (tm). Not every serving has to have any particular
portion, and multiple portions of the same food can be used if
desired. The portions have respectively 250, 100, 100, 50, 150, and
200 calories. (1) Construct a GF counting the number of
servings with n calories, if all the portions are served by putting
them around the edge of a circular plate, and we don&#8217;t care if the
plate is rotated. (2) Construct a GF counting the number of
servings with n calories, if all the portions are served by dumping
them into a large plastic bag.</p></li>

<li><p>5.11 Supplementary exercises: 2.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1. Use the transfer matrix method to compute generating functions
that count the following. In all of them you can assume that there
is one length 0 string (if length 0 makes sense &#8230; this is not a
serious issue either way). (You can use wolfram alpha to compute
determinants if you don&#8217;t have access to anything else.)</p>

<p>1a. The number of binary strings of length n that begin with 0 and
end with 1. Answer: x<sup>2</sup>/(1&#8211;2x)</p>

<p>1b. The number of binary strings of length n that have any number of
zeros and an even number of 1&#8217;s. (The 1&#8217;s don&#8217;t have to be
consecutive.) Answer: (1-x)/(1&#8211;2x)</p>

<p>1c. The number of binary strings of length n that don&#8217;t have the
substring 111. Answer: (-x<sup>2</sup> - x - 1)/(x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x - 1)</p>

<p>1d. The number of length n strings built from the characters {0,1,2} that
don&#8217;t contain 01 or 12 as a substring. Answer: -1/(x<sup>3</sup> - 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 1)</p></li>
<li><p>2. Let G be the 3-cycle (vertices {1,2,3}, edges {12, 23, 13}), also
known as the complete graph on 3 vertices.</p>

<p>2a. Write the adjacency matrix A for G.</p>

<p>2b. Let a(n) be the number of n-step walks from vertex 1 to vertex
1, and let b(n) be the number of n-step walks from vertex 1 to
vertex 2. Compute a(n), b(n) for n&lt;=4.</p>

<p>2c. Show that a(n) = (2<sup>n</sup> + 2*(-1)<sup>n</sup>)/3 and b(n) = (2<sup>n</sup> +
(-1)^(n-1))/3.</p></li>
<li><p>3.</p>

<p>3a. Draw the 11 unlabeled trees on 7 vertices. (Check your work <a href="https://oeis.org/A000055/a000055_3.pdf">here</a>.)</p>

<p>3b. For each, determine the number of labelings and verify that
there are 7<sup>5</sup> labeled trees on 7 vertices (this requires adding 11
moderately sized integers).</p>

<p>3c. Determine which are represented by the following Pruefer
codes.</p>

<p>i. [1,2,3,4,5]</p>

<p>ii. [1,3,2,2,2]</p>

<p>iii. [2,2,2,2,2]</p></li>
