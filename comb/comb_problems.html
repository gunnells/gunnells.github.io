<li><p>Extra problem 1: Build a GF for the following
constructions. It is not necessary to compute the coefficients
explicitly. Suppose we have beads in masses 1g, 2g, 3g, &#8230; .
Each bead comes in one of two different colors. Explain how to
count (1) Lists of seven beads with total mass n grams. (2) Arbitrary
lengh lists of beads with mass n grams. (3) Necklaces of arbitrary
size of beads with total mass n grams. (4) Number of ways to make a
bag of beads with total mass n grams. (5) Number of ways to make a
bag of beads with total mass n grams, where each bead of a given
color may be used at most once.</p></li>
<li><p>Extra problem 2: Thanksgiving dinner servings are to be assembled
from portions of turkey, stuffing, potatoes, cranberry sauce, gravy,
and Lemonheads (tm). Not every serving has to have any particular
portion, and multiple portions of the same food can be used if
desired. The portions have respectively 250, 100, 100, 50, 150, and
200 calories. (1) Construct a GF counting the number of
servings with n calories, if all the portions are served by putting
them around the edge of a circular plate, and we don&#8217;t care if the
plate is rotated. (2) Construct a GF counting the number of
servings with n calories, if all the portions are served by dumping
them into a large plastic bag.</p></li>
