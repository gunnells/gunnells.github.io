<p>The primary method of course material distribution will be through the
course website (what you are currently viewing). The instructor will
also send information to your campus email from time to time. To
contact me, please send email to my university account (gunnells
at umass dot edu).</p>

<h2 id="examii">Exam II</h2>

<p>Exam II will be Wednesday, 5 November, 7&#8211;9pm, location GSMN0051. The
deadline for requesting a makeup exam has passed. The exam will cover
14.8 Lagrange Multipliers through 15.8 Triple Integrals in Spherical
Coordinates. The TA will do a review in recitation on the Wednesday
of the exam.</p>

<p>There are some review sessions for Math 233, since their exam is the
same day. However be aware that their exam may cover different
sections (and will not include some topics that we do, such as center
of mass/centroid). Nevertheless they might be helpful.</p>
