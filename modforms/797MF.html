<h3 id="instructorinformation">Instructor Information</h3>

<p>Paul Gunnells (LGRT 1115L, 545&#8211;6009, gunnells@umass.edu). Office Hours: TBA</p>

<h3 id="coursedescription">Course Description</h3>

<p>This course treats modular forms, their relation
to arithmetic and geometry, and other applications. Modular forms are
a fundamental tool in modern number theory and have applications to
many other fields, such as algebraic geometry, representation theory,
combinatorics, and mathematical physics. Topics include the
following: geometry of the upper half plane and quotients by
congruence subgroups, Eisenstein series/cuspforms/theta series,
Fourier expansions, L-functions, Hecke theory, applications of modular
forms to arithmetic and combinatorics. Prerequisites: Math 611–612 or
the consent of the instructor. Other helpful courses: number theory,
complex analysis.</p>

<h3 id="studentlearningobjectives">Student Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>The primary learning objective of this course
is for students to learn the language of modular forms. The goal of the course
is to prepare students to do research in mathematical disciplines which rely on
modular forms as well as to prepare them for more advanced courses in number
theory/arithmetic geometry. An additional objective involves working
on mathematical writing.</p>

<p>Specific learning objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Students will learn the language of modular forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Students will become familiar with basic examples and theorems, such as
the generation of the ring of modular forms of full level.</p></li>
<li><p>Students will learn advanced applications of modular forms functions such
as connections to elliptic curves and Galois representations.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also important to practice mathematical exposition, since that
forms a basic skill needed for writing a dissertation. To that end, in
this class students will learn how to write an expository mathematics
paper on an advanced topic.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deliverymode">Delivery Mode</h3>

<p>The class will consist of 150 min of face-to-face lecture per week.</p>

<h3 id="coursematerials">Course materials</h3>

<p>There is no required textbook. Some materials for reading will
be provided by the instructor. Some suggested books/papers that might occasionally
be mentioned:</p>

<h3 id="courserequirementsandgradeweights">Course requirements and grade weights</h3>

<h4 id="courseparticipation">Course participation</h4>

<p>Students will be expected to actively participate in the course.
Participation is defined very broadly and includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><p>Asking questions/making comments during lecture, by email or in office
hours.</p></p></li>
<li><p>Attending class regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussing course material with the instructor and their peers.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussing ideas and interests for the expository paper with the instructor.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussing the writing process and seeking additional help (as needed) with
preparing the expository paper.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is understood that students with a variety of obligations and interests will be
taking the course. This component will count 50%.</p>

<h4 id="finalpaper">Final paper</h4>

<p>Together with the instructor, by the end of week 7 each student will
pick a topic of interest to them that is related to the course material (A list of
suggested topics will be made available, but students are free to pick others). The
student will then prepare an expository paper of up to 10 pages on this topic and
will submit a first draft by the end of week 10. The papers will be reviewed by the
instructor and given back to students for revisions, which should be done by the
end of the term. More details about timing are given below in the lecture schedule.
The instructor will be available for additional writing support outside scheduled
office hours. This assignment will count 50%.</p>

<h3 id="gradingscale">Grading Scale</h3>

<p>The final grade will be based on course participation (50%) and
the final paper (50%). Letter grades will be assigned as follows:</p>
