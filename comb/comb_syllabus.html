<h2 id="instructor">Instructor</h2>

<p>Prof. Paul Gunnells, LGRT 1115L, 545&#8211;6009, gunnells at umass dot edu.
The best way to contact me is by email. Please don&#8217;t leave a message
on my office phone; I almost never listen to messages there.</p>

<h2 id="courseoverview">Course overview</h2>

<p>Combinatorics is the mathematical science of counting. The goal of
this course is to study some techniques in combinatorics; one
particular emphasis is generating functions. We will study
applications to various counting problems, including some from graph
theory.</p>

<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>

<h3 id="requiredtext:">Required text:</h3>

<p><em>Introduction to Enumerative and Analytic Combinatorics, Third Edition</em>
by Miklos Bona. ISBN: 978&#8211;1482249095.
<a href="comb_text_contents.html">Table of contents</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that this is the <strong>third</strong> edition of this book.</p>

<p>The textbook is very readable; the author has put a lot of work into
his exposition, and there are many examples given in detail. There is
a lot of material in the textbook, way more than we can cover in one
semester. We will try to cover all of the <em>Methods</em> and <em>Topics</em>
sections, with possibly some extra material.</p>

<p>It will be presumed that you are reading the relevant sections of the
textbook outside of class.</p>

<h3 id="recommendedtexts:">Recommended texts:</h3>

<p>We will not follow these sources, but they are excellent and have lots
of interesting material. Occasionally we may refer to them.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>The grading for the course will be as follows. There will be a final
exam worth 30%, and two exams during the semester each worth 25%. The
remaining 20% will be based on homework exercises.</p>

<p>After being determined by the above algorithm, the total score will be
<em>truncated</em> down to the nearest integer less than or equal to the
total score. (Note that truncation is not the same as rounding. For
example, a score of 89.75 will be truncated to 89, not rounded to 90.
This is standard policy in courses offered in the Math and Stat
Department.) The letter grade will then be determined by the
following scale:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col />

<h2 id="finalexam">Final Exam</h2>

<p>The final will be cumulative, with some emphasis placed on topics
covered after the midterm exam. The date and time will be announced
by the University. The final will only be given during the scheduled
time.</p>

<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>

<p>There will be two midterm exams, given in the evening.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tuesday, 14 October, 7&#8211;9pm, location LGRCA301. Request makeup if
necessary by Tuesday, 30 September.</p></li>
<li><p>Thursday, 6 November, 7&#8211;9pm, location LGRCA301. Request makeup if
necessary by Thursday, 23 October.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The exam times are 2 hours to take some of the pressure off. It is
not expected that you will need the full 2 hours to complete them.</p>

<p>Sections covered on an exam, as well as other exam policies, will be
announced in class some time before the exam date. Some time in the
lecture before each exam will be devoted to review.</p>

<p>See below for the academic honesty statement about exams.</p>

<h2 id="make-upexamrequest">Make-up exam request</h2>

<p>Re-taking of exams is not allowed in this course: once an exam has
been taken it cannot be retaken or made up.</p>

<p>You are expected to take all exams, including the final exam, during
their scheduled times. All students should check your travel plans
and exam schedules of your courses carefully. If you have any schedule
conflicts, you may log on the Spire page, go to &#8220;Student Home&#8221; and
then to &#8220;Evening Exam Conflict&#8221;. This will allow you to fill out a
conflict form and submit it. Then the registrar will email your
instructor who needs to provide a makeup exam. Makeup exams should be
requested at least two weeks before the exam.</p>

<p>Which case and where is the official support document for the make-up
request?</p>

<p>(1) if you have an exam (or a class) schedule conflicts with the
regular exam, you should log on the Spire page, go to &#8220;Student Home&#8221;
and then to &#8220;Evening Exam Conflict&#8221;. This will allow you to fill out a
conflict form and submit it. Then the registrar will email your
instructor who needs to provide a makeup exam.</p>

<p>(2) if you have a university trip for university business during the
regular exam date, like an athletic competition or academic conference
etc., you should ask your supervisor or your coach to write an
explanation letter including his/her phone number to your instructor
as the official written document. Your instructor may verify the event
by phone call.</p>

<p>(3) if you have a religious observance on a regular exam date and can
NOT take the exam, you should write an explanation letter yourself and
attach the invitation letter or relevant information as the official
document.</p>

<p>(4) if you have a medical reason and can not take the regular exam,
you should ask a medical professional&#8217;s statement including his/her
phone number which indicates that you were unable for medical reason
to take the scheduled exam. If the medical professional&#8217;s statement is
not given before the exam, your instructor may refuse your make-up
request.</p>

<h2 id="computing">Computing</h2>

<p>This is not a programming course, and assignments will not require
coding. However many computations for examples and problems will
benefit from using a computer. For an overview of software
you might find useful, see <a href="comb_computation.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="problemsets">Problem Sets</h2>

<p>Problem sets will be assigned on the <a href="comb.html">main course page</a>;
method of collection will be determined once we have a grader. Late
problem sets will not be accepted for any reason. At the end of the
term, a few problem set grades will be dropped, so missing one or two
problem set submissions shouldn&#8217;t affect your grade.</p>

<p>Only selected problems (randomly chosen by me) will be graded. The
book contains some exercises with complete solutions for self-study.
These will be part of the homework, but they will not be graded.</p>

<p>I encourage you to form study groups and to work on the problem sets
together. In fact you will learn a lot more about the material
through discussing it with your fellow students. However, there are a
few guidelines to follow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remember that ultimately you&#8217;ll be taking exams by yourself, so if
you choose to work with others, make sure that you&#8217;re understanding
what&#8217;s going on.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do work with other students, you are responsible for writing
up the problems yourself in your own words. In other words, your
solution must be sunmitted separately; there are no group homework
submissions allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do work with your students on a problem set, you must
indicate this on the first page of your HW submission. Please
include the names of the students you worked with. This alerts the
grader that some of your solutions may closely resemble other
students and that there is nothing amiss.</p></li>
<li><p>It is expressly forbidden to use means that do not represent your
own work (such as, but not limited to, generative AI and copying
solutions from online forums) to complete problem sets. (See the
academic honesty statement below for more info.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Successful completion of the problem sets is essential to help you
monitor your progress in the course. The homework problems will be
very similar to problems that appear on exams. Please don&#8217;t postpone
working on the problems; try to take a look at them shortly after the
material is covered in class.</p>

<h2 id="help">Help</h2>

<p>I try to answer as many questions as possible during lecture. If you
have a question, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask. Chances are other students
also have the same question. I also usually stick around a few
minutes after class to answer quick questions (such as questions about
parts of the lecture, a homework problem you&#8217;ve tried, etc.). Most
students find this to be a good way to clear up confusion.</p>

<p>Outside of class, the best way to get help is through my office hours.
Sometimes only a little bit of consultation is all that&#8217;s needed to
deal with difficulties. One thing to remember is that you will get
much more out of office hours if you make a serious effort to do the
problem on your own first.</p>

<p>Although I like to get a lot of questions from students, it is not
possible to answer mathematical questions by email. Please don&#8217;t be
offended if you ask me a mathematical question by email and I don&#8217;t
respond. I&#8217;ve found in the past that trying to discuss mathematics by
email rarely helps anyone, and usually only causes more confusion.
It&#8217;s much more effective to ask me such questions during class or
office hours.</p>

<h2 id="specialaccommodation">Special Accommodation</h2>

<p>The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making
reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs
of students with disabilities and help create a barrier-free
campus. If you have a disability and require accommodations, please
register with Disability Services (161 Whitmore Administration
building; phone 413&#8211;545&#8211;0892), meet with an Access Coordinator and
send an accommodation letter to your faculty. Information on services
and materials for registering are also available on the website
www.umass.edu/disability.</p>

<p>Special accommodation request: new disability students should be
certified by Umass disability service center (DSC) at first, then you
should ask DSC to send the special accommodation documents to your
instructor at least two weeks before exam 1 or exam 2, after that you
may contact DSC,</p>

<pre><code>Trisha Link
Exam Proctoring Coordinator
examsaccess@admin.umass.edu
413-545-0892
169A Whitmore
</code></pre>

<p>directly to schedule an appointment, DSC will notify you when and
where to take the exam in a few days before the exam . For the
documented disability students, DSC will notify you when you should
schedule the final exam in DSC.</p>

<h2 id="academichonestystatement">Academic Honesty Statement</h2>

<p>Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of
higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research,
academic honesty is required of all students at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all
programs of the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not
limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating
dishonesty. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who
has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take
reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has
reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty
should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate
course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic
dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the
attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students
are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted
standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not
normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent. For more information
see the website of
<a href="http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/">Dean of Students Office</a>.</p>

<p>Expectations for our course as as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For homework, as discussed above, you will be allowed to work with
other students collaboratively. In fact, I encourage you to form
study groups to work together. However, it is your responsibility
to make sure that you are learning the material. You also must
submit your own work, indicating if you collaborated with any other
students.</p></li>
<li><p>The written work you submit must be original. The use of online or
other sources for solutions, or the use of generative AI tools such
as ChatGPT to produce or write solutions will be considered a
violation of academic honesty. Generative AI usage for other means
related to the course (like as a study partner, sounding board,
etc.) is not considered a violation, but it is the responsibility of
the student to verify the accuracy of any content used in that
context. (You&#8217;re much better off just reading something written by
a reputable source, or collaborating with other students in the
course, in my opinion.)</p></li>
<li><p>All exams will be done in-person and are closed book: no
supplemental materials such as the textbook or notes may be used.
Devices such as phones, watches, calculators, and computers, are not
allowed to be used during exams. Of course no communication between
students in any form is allowed during exams. Use of any
unauthorized resources will be considered a violation of academic
honesty and will be handled accordingly.</p></li>
</ul>
