<h1 id="honorsmultivariatecalculusmath233hsyllabus">Honors Multivariate Calculus (Math 233H) Syllabus</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Math 233H is the third and final semester of the calculus sequence. It
develops the extension of calculus to functions of several variables.
In particular, we study vectors, partial derivatives, double and
triple integrals, line integrals, and surface integrals. The
culmination of the course several generalizations of the fundamental
theorem of calculus: Green&#8217;s theorem, Stokes&#8217;s theorem, and the
divergence theorem.</p>

<p>This is a four-credit course, with three hours of lecture and one hour
of discussion section weekly. The pace of the course is rapid. The
honors section will cover the same material as in Math 233, although
the course will be more demanding.</p>

<h2 id="textbookandwebassign">Textbook and WebAssign</h2>

<p>Homeworks and the textbook are available through Cengage&#8217;s WebAssign
system. You should self enroll there (you get some free days of access
before you have to pay). This is the same setup used by main Math 233
course. The textbook is called <em>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</em> (9th
Edition: Customized Hybrid Edition) by James Stewart.</p>

<p>The easiest way to sign up is</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Go to <a href="http://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up using the <em>Class Key</em> for our course. It is</p>

<pre><code>umass 5528 0600
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Here is a
<a href="https://www.getenrolled.com/?courseKey=umass55280600">direct link</a>
you can use to sign up with the class key.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also sign up through the Canvas course, although I don&#8217;t know
the details. There is some information about that
<a href="https://www.cengage.com/coursepages/UMassMATH233Canvas">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>The grading for the course will be as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Final exam 25%</p></li>
<li><p>Exams I and II, 20% each</p></li>
<li><p>Webassign HW, 15%</p></li>
<li><p>Recitation, 15%</p></li>
<li><p>Class participation, 5%</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remarksaboutgrading">Remarks about grading</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>See below for information about the class participation grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Attendance will be required in recitation, and will be part of the
recitation&#8217;s contribution to your final grade.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the term, some of your webassign scores will be
dropped (at least 3). This way, if you don&#8217;t do as well on an
assignment because of extra work in another course or for any reason,
it shouldn&#8217;t affect your final homework grade. Extensions for HW are
not granted except for documented reasons, as described in the
Make-Up Exam section.</p></li>
<li><p>After being determined by the above algorithm, the total score will
be <em>truncated</em> down to the nearest integer less than or equal to the
total score. (Note that truncation is not the same as rounding.
For example, a score of 89.75 will be truncated to 89, not rounded
to 90. This is standard policy in courses offered in the Math and
Stat Department.) The letter grade will then be determined by the
following scale:</p></li>

<h2 id="finalexam">Final Exam</h2>

<p>The final will be cumulative, with some emphasis placed on topics
covered after the midterm exam. The date and time will be announced
by the University. The final will only be given during the scheduled
time, check SPIRE periodically to see when it is scheduled.</p>

<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>

<p>This course will have two evening midterm exams.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Exam I, Wednesday, 15 October, 7&#8211;9pm, location TBA. Request makeup
if necessary by Wednesday, 1 October.</p></li>
<li><p>Exam II, Wednesday, 5 November, 7&#8211;9pm, location TBA. Request makeup
if necessary by Wednesday, 22 October.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sections covered on individual exams will be announced beforehand.</p>

<p>See below for the academic honesty statement about exams.</p>

<h2 id="make-upexamrequest">Make-up exam request</h2>

<p>Re-taking of exams is not allowed in this course: once an exam has
been taken it cannot be retaken or made up.</p>

<p>You are expected to take all exams, including the final exam, during
their scheduled times. All students should check your travel plans
and exam schedules of your courses carefully. If you have any schedule
conflicts, you may log on the Spire page, go to &#8220;Student Home&#8221; and
then to &#8220;Evening Exam Conflict&#8221;. This will allow you to fill out a
conflict form and submit it. Then the registrar will email your
instructor who needs to provide a makeup exam. Makeup exams must be
requested at least two weeks before the exam.</p>

<p>Which case and where is the official support document for the make-up
request?</p>

<p>(1) if you have an exam (or a class) schedule conflicts with the
regular exam, you should log on the Spire page, go to &#8220;Student Home&#8221;
and then to &#8220;Evening Exam Conflict&#8221;. This will allow you to fill out a
conflict form and submit it. Then the registrar will email your
instructor who needs to provide a makeup exam.</p>

<p>(2) if you have a university trip for university business during the
regular exam date, like an athletic competition or academic conference
etc., you should ask your supervisor or your coach to write an
explanation letter including his/her phone number to your instructor
as the official written document. Your instructor may verify the event
by phone call.</p>

<p>(3) if you have a religious observance on a regular exam date and can
NOT take the exam, you should write an explanation letter yourself and
attach the invitation letter or relevant information as the official
document.</p>

<p>(4) if you have a medical reason and can not take the regular exam,
you should ask a medical professional&#8217;s statement including his/her
phone number which indicates that you were unable for medical reason
to take the scheduled exam. If the medical professional&#8217;s statement is
not given before the exam, your instructor may refuse your make-up
request.</p>

<h2 id="remarksabouthomework">Remarks about Homework</h2>

<p>I encourage you to form study groups and to work on the problem sets
together. In fact you will learn a lot more about the material
through discussing it with your fellow students. However, there are a
few guidelines to follow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remember that ultimately you&#8217;ll be taking exams by yourself, so if
you choose to work with others, make sure that you&#8217;re understanding
what&#8217;s going on.</p></li>
<li><p>It is expressly forbidden to use means that do not represent your
own work (such as, but not limited to, generative AI and copying
solutions from online forums) to complete problem sets. (See the
academic honesty statement below for more info.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Successful completion of the problem sets is essential to help you
monitor your progress in the course. They are the main way to make
sure you are properly preparing for exams. Please don&#8217;t postpone
working on the problems; try to take a look at them shortly after the
material is covered in class.</p>

<h2 id="classparticipationgrade">Class participation grade</h2>

<p>According to the syllabus, 5% of your grade will come from class
participation. This will be done using <strong>quick in-class problems</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A short problem will be written on the board. Such problems will be
simple exercises from the class material, not longer more involved
problems that typically appear in HW and on exams.</p></li>
<li><p>You will quickly work it out on paper and then submit it.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem will then be graded, with an emphasis on participation, not
correctness. The problems will not be returned to you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The whole process should take just a few minutes. A few further
points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When I say simple, I mean it. If this were Math 131, it would be
things on the order of <strong>Graph y=x<sup>2</sup> + 1</strong>, <strong>Compute the derivative
of x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 3</strong>, etc.
Of course Math 233H is more difficult, but this is really about
participation.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite the emphasis on participation, you should really try to get
these right. They should be pedagogically helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>This won&#8217;t happen every lecture, but randomly during the term (when
the urge strikes me). Note that otherwise attendance is <strong>not</strong>
taken.</p></li>
<li><p>These problems will only appear in lecture. No record of them will
be kept otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not possible to make up or redo these assignments for any
reason. At the end of the term I will drop a few scores (number to
be determined). If you happen to miss a few lectures your grade
should not suffer.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="help">Help</h2>

<p>I try to answer as many questions as possible during lecture. If you
have a question, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask. Chances are other students
also have the same question. I also usually stick around a few
minutes after class to answer quick questions (such as questions about
parts of the lecture, a homework problem you&#8217;ve tried, etc.). Most
students find this to be a good way to clear up confusion.</p>

<p>You should also make full use of your discussion section. In
particular the teaching assistant is there to help you with your
questions and to support your work in the course. Take advantage of
this opportunity!</p>

<p>Outside of class, the best way to get help is through my office hours,
the teaching assistant&#8217;s office hours, and the CTC (Calculus Tutoring
Center, LGRT 140). Sometimes only a little bit of
consultation is all that&#8217;s needed to deal with difficulties. One
thing to remember is that you will get much more out of office
hours/CTC if you make a serious effort to do the problem on your own
first.</p>

<p>There is also some drop-in tutoring and supplemental instruction
offered during the term at WEB DuBois library through the
<a href="http://www.umass.edu/lrc/">Learning Resource Center</a>. Please see
their website for more details. This is an excellent resource that is
often under-utilized. Many students have found this helpful.</p>

<p>Although I like to get a lot of questions from students, it is not
possible to answer mathematical questions by email. Please don&#8217;t be
offended if you ask me a mathematical question by email and I don&#8217;t
respond. I&#8217;ve found in the past that trying to discuss mathematics by
email rarely helps anyone, and usually only causes more confusion.
It&#8217;s much more effective to ask me such questions during class or
office hours.</p>

<h2 id="specialaccommodation">Special Accommodation</h2>

<p>The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making
reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs
of students with disabilities and help create a barrier-free
campus. If you have a disability and require accommodations, please
register with Disability Services (161 Whitmore Administration
building; phone 413&#8211;545&#8211;0892), meet with an Access Coordinator and
send an accommodation letter to your faculty. Information on services
and materials for registering are also available on the website
www.umass.edu/disability.</p>

<p>Special accommodation request: new disability students should be
certified by Umass disability service center (DSC) at first, then you
should ask DSC to send the special accommodation documents to your
instructor at least two weeks before exam 1 or exam 2, after that you
may contact DSC,</p>

<pre><code>Trisha Link
Exam Proctoring Coordinator
examsaccess@admin.umass.edu
413-545-0892

</code></pre>

<p>directly to schedule an appointment, DSC will notify you when and
where to take the exam in a few days before the exam . For the
documented disability students, DSC will notify you when you should
schedule the final exam in DSC.</p>

<h2 id="academichonestystatement">Academic Honesty Statement</h2>

<p>Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of
higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research,
academic honesty is required of all students at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all
programs of the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not
limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating
dishonesty. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who
has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take
reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has
reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty
should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate
course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic
dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the
attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students
are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted
standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not
normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent. For more information
see the website of
<a href="http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/">Dean of Students Office</a>.</p>

<p>Expectations for our course as as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For homework, as discussed above, you will be allowed to work with
other students collaboratively. In fact, I encourage you to form
study groups to work together. However, it is your responsibility
to make sure that you are learning the material and to submit your
own solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>The work you do must be original. The use of online or other
sources for solutions, or the use of generative AI tools such as
ChatGPT to produce solutions will be considered a violation of
academic honesty. Generative AI usage for other means related to
the course (like as a study partner, sounding board, etc.) is not
considered a violation, but it is the responsibility of the student
to verify the accuracy of any content used in that context. (You&#8217;re
much better off just reading something written by a reputable
source, or collaborating with other students in the course, in my
opinion.)</p></li>
<li><p>All exams will be done in-person and are closed book: no
supplemental materials such as the textbook or notes may be used.
Devices such as phones, watches, calculators, and computers, are not
allowed to be used during exams. Of course no communication between
students in any form is allowed during exams. Use of any
unauthorized resources will be considered a violation of academic
honesty and will be handled accordingly.</p></li>
</ul>
